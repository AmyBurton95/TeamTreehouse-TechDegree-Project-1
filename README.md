# TeamTreehouse-TechDegree-Project-1
 A number guessing game for Data Analysist Project 1

 ## Introduction:
 This project was created as my first beginner application for Python with the TeamTreeHouse Team! I am exciting to start my journey in coding and data analysis.

 Built with:
 PyCharm Community Edition 2024

 ### How to Play
 The user is asked for their player name, it they then see a personalised introduction to the game and an invitation to play.

 Once the player confirms " Y ", the start_game() function is initiated, where a random number is created and the player is asked to guess a number between the " low " & " high " variables. If the player does not enter an integer, a ValueError is handled and asks the player to try again.

 If the player guesses incorrectly, the game will indicate whether it is too high or too low. If the player guesses correctly, they are shown how many guesses it took and asked whether they'd like to play again. If " Y " the function runs again, if " Y " is not chosen, the player is given the chance to see their stats and stops the game from running again. If " Y " is chosen, a highscore is shown to the player to see what the lowest guesses was to beat. At the start of the game there is no highscore, so the len function is used and prints that there is no highscore yet.
